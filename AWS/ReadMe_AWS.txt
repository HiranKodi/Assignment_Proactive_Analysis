The 3rd assignment is still in progress.

I managed to create an EC2 instance and create a lambda function.
I'm still in the process of understanding how all the functionalities should
be synchronised to get the final output.
I will push the updated solution asap.

UPDATE:

I created an EC2 instance in Linux environment.
instance_init.sh contains the BASH script file to execute the commands.
2 lambda functions are created for this task. Each for registration and secret
key update.

Since AWS is something I have yet to gain experience in, I studied the following
topics to complete this assignment.
- BASH scripting 
- Linux command guide
- EC2 and Lambda functions
- JSON in python
I followed several Youtube videos and blogs to achieve the above. I also seeked
assistance from ChatGPT to clear doubts on some grey areas that I did not 
understand.
